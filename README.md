# VIP Originality Checker 🎭

> **Innovation is hard. Picking a name shouldn't be.**

Use this tool to avoid the embarrassment of naming your AI the same thing as everyone else.

## 🎉 How It Works

1. **Enter the Club** — You arrive at the Innovation Club's VIP entrance
2. **Face the Bouncer** — Give him your AI's name
3. **Get Judged** — If it's taken, you get roasted and kicked out
4. **Or Get In** — If it's original, welcome to the party!

## 🚫 Already Taken

- Cody 🤖
